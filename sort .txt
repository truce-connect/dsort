Problem: [4  9  5  3  1  6]
          0  1  2  3  4  5
 Sorting the algorithm

Step 1: compare index0 to index1
  if 0 is greater than index1 swap it if no leave it and move to the next index
  [4  9  5  3  1  6].

Step 2: compare index1 to index2
 if index1 is greater than index2 swap it if no leave it and move to the next index
 [4  5  9  3  1  6].

 Step 3: compare index2 to index3
 if index2 is greater than index3 swap it if no leave it and move to the next index
 [4  5  3  9  1  6].

Step 4: compare index3 to index4
 if index3 is greater than index4 swap it if no leave it and move to the next index
 [4  5  3  1  9  6].

Step 5: compare index4 to index5
 if index4 is greater than index5 swap it if no leave it and move to the next index
 [4  5  3  1  6  9].

Step 6: compare index0 and index1 to index2
 if index0 and index1 is greater than index2 swap it if no leave it and move to the next index
 [3  4  5  1  6  9].

Step 7:  compare index0, index1 and index2 to index3
  if index0,index1 and index2 is greater than index3 swap it if no leave it
  [1  3  4  5  6  9].
